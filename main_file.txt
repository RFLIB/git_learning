This is the main file, changes will be stage every line:

peer1 - created first commit and pushed
peer1 - second commit and push
peer2 first commit and push


created conflict. peer1 and peer2 push to the same line different values. conflict appears after merging conflicting branch, and specify the files of conflict. in this stage when you open the file you will see markers:
1. Everything between <<<<<<< HEAD and ======= is from main
2. Everything between ======= and >>>>>>> peer1 is from the other branch
You can edit the file as you want, and push


Peer1 work. peer1 merged with peer2 creating conflict. in this case you can't do pull, and if you use rebse, you have to rebase --continue to complete the process otherwise you can keep working. Then resolve all conlicts merging peer1 and main
